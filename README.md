# Poeta React Native boilerplate

This project is a [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) boilerplate that can be used to kickstart a mobile application.

The boilerplate provides **an optimized architecture for building solid cross-platform mobile applications** through separation of concerns between the UI and business logic. It is fully documented so that each piece of code that lands in your application can be understood and used.
We wan't to say thanks with The Code Machine, We learn the idea from their boilterplate

You also need to install the dependencies required by React Native.  
Go to the [React Native environment setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup), then select `React Native CLI Quickstart` tab.  
Follow instructions for your given `development OS` and `target OS`.
